## **Overview**

### **Description**
LG AIS Visualization is a app designed to provide real-time tracking, detailed vessel information, predictive route analysis, and collision risk management. It is optimized for Liquid Galaxy systems, allowing seamless synchronization of maps between the rig and the app. The app can also function standalone, providing maritime insights based on open AIS data from the Norwegian Coastal Administration

### The Importance of Real-Time Maritime Data Visualization

The maritime industry is the backbone of global trade, with over 90% of global trade carried by sea. Ensuring the safety and efficiency of maritime operations is critical, not only for economic reasons but also for environmental protection and the well-being of seafarers.

Recent events, like the catastrophe of the Baltimore Key Bridge collapse after a ship collision, highlight the devastating consequences of accidents at sea. Such incidents can cause significant economic damage, environmental harm, and loss of life.

### **Technology Used**
- **Flutter**
- **Dart**
- **KML (Keyhole Markup Language)**
- **Google Earth Visualization**
- **Google Maps Integration**
- **Machine Learning (K-Nearest Neighbors)**

## Main Features and Functionalities

1. **Real-Time Vessels Tracking::**
   - Streaming the vessels movement 

2. **Vessel Information Display:** 
   - Users can select a vessel to display detailed information such as:
     - Name
     - Country
     - Vessel Type
     - Navigation Details: Speed Over Ground, Course Over Ground, Navigational Status, Rate of Turn, Heading, Last Known Position
     - Vessel Characteristics: Ship Type, Call Sign, Destination, ETA, IMO Number, Draught
     - Physical Dimensions: Dimension A, Dimension B, Dimension C, Dimension D, Ship Length, Ship Width
     - Positioning Details: Position Fixing Device Type, Report Class

3. **Historical Route Playback:** 
   - View past routes and analyze vessel movements.

4. **Future Route Prediction:** 
   - Predict potential future routes using historical data.

5. **Collision Risk Management:** 
   - Users can select any two vessels to calculate the Closest Point of Approach (CPA) and Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA). This feature is crucial for collision avoidance.

6. **Region-Specific Vessel Display:** 
   - Users can freely draw a specific region to show the current vessels within it.

7. **Filter Mechanism:** 
   - The app supports filtering based on the type of vessel (up to 70 types with search)
